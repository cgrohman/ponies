Hypothesis 1:
  - Use all horses and race information + horse of interest, to classify as WPS or not.
  - AR: Find max number of horses in the field. For all races that do not have that number of horses data will be filled in respectively.

  Determine to bet or not? Run the classifier on all horses of a race, pick the top 3 (by percentage to WPS), then determine if payoff is worth the trifecta box price.
